## 关于做任何事的动机
>  There are three things that have meaning for life.They are the motivational factors for everything in your life-for any-thing that you do or any living thing does: The first is survival, the second is social order, and the third is entertainment. Everything in life progresses in that order.And there is nothing after entertainment. So, in a sense,the implication is that the meaning of life is to reach that third stage. And once you've reached the third stage,you're done. But you have to go through the other stages  
> 有三件事具有生命的意义。它们是你生活当中所有事情的动机。第一是生存，第二是社会秩序，第三是娱乐。生活中所有的事情都是按这个顺序发展的，娱乐之后便一无所有。因此，从某种意义上来说，生活的意义就是要达到第三个阶段。你一旦达到了第三个阶段，就算成功了。但首先要越过前两个阶段。


社会秩序怎么理解？
