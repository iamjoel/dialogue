## 为什么主动的选择忙碌
是在逃避思考，逃避现实。

> [Research](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20548057/) shows that humans tend to do whatever it takes to keep busy, even if the activity feels meaningless to them. Dr Brené Brown from the University of Houston describes being “crazy busy” as a numbing strategy we use to avoid facing the truth of our lives.  
> 研究表明，人类倾向于不惜一切代价保持忙碌，即使这项活动对他们来说毫无意义。休斯顿大学的布蕾妮·布朗博士将“疯狂忙碌”描述为一种麻木的策略，我们用它来避免面对生活的真相。

> We are scared of idleness because stopping would mean having to really consider what we want out of life and what we currently have. Sometimes, the gap feels so wide, we’d rather stay on the hamster wheel.  
> 我们害怕无所事事，因为停下来意味着必须真正考虑我们想要从生活中得到什么以及我们目前拥有什么。有时，差距感觉如此之大，我们宁愿留在仓鼠轮上。

## 忙碌的坏处
> Time is like a river. If you’re too busy to enjoy life—too busy to spend time with friends and family, too busy to learn how to paint or play the guitar, too busy to go on that hike, too busy to cook something nice for yourself—these moments will be gone, and you will never get that time back.  
> 时间就像一条河。如果您太忙而无法享受生活 - 太忙而无法与朋友和家人共度时光，太忙而无法学习如何绘画或弹吉他，太忙而无法去远足，太忙而无法为自己做饭 - 这些瞬间就会过去，而你将永远不会再找回那段时光。

## 如何行动
> Next time you think of learning something new, or a friend asks you if you want to do something together or have a chat, and your automatic answer is: “I’m just too busy”, take a few minutes to actually consider whether you are actually too busy, and, if that’s the case, whether this busyness is more valuable to you in the long-term than learning something new or spending time with your friend.  
> 下次当你想学习新东西，或者朋友问你是否想一起做某事或聊天时，你的自动回答是：“我太忙了”，花几分钟时间考虑一下你是否愿意实际上太忙了，如果是这样的话，从长远来看，这种忙碌对你来说是否比学习新东西或与朋友共度时光更有价值。
