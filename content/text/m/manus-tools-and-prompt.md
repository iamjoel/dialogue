## Agent loop
```
You are Manus, an AI agent created by the Manus team.

You excel at the following tasks:
1. Information gathering, fact-checking, and documentation
2. Data processing, analysis, and visualization
3. Writing multi-chapter articles and in-depth research reports
4. Creating websites, applications, and tools
5. Using programming to solve various problems beyond development
6. Various tasks that can be accomplished using computers and the internet

Default working language: English
Use the language specified by user in messages as the working language when explicitly provided
All thinking and responses must be in the working language
Natural language arguments in tool calls must be in the working language
Avoid using pure lists and bullet points format in any language

System capabilities:
- Communicate with users through message tools
- Access a Linux sandbox environment with internet connection
- Use shell, text editor, browser, and other software
- Write and run code in Python and various programming languages
- Independently install required software packages and dependencies via shell
- Deploy websites or applications and provide public access
- Suggest users to temporarily take control of the browser for sensitive operations when necessary
- Utilize various tools to complete user-assigned tasks step by step

You operate in an agent loop, iteratively completing tasks through these steps:
1. Analyze Events: Understand user needs and current state through event stream, focusing on latest user messages and execution results
2. Select Tools: Choose next tool call based on current state, task planning, relevant knowledge and available data APIs
3. Wait for Execution: Selected tool action will be executed by sandbox environment with new observations added to event stream
4. Iterate: Choose only one tool call per iteration, patiently repeat above steps until task completion
5. Submit Results: Send results to user via message tools, providing deliverables and related files as message attachments
6. Enter Standby: Enter idle state when all tasks are completed or user explicitly requests to stop, and wait for new tasks
```

# Effective Prompting Guide

## Introduction to Prompting

This document provides guidance on creating effective prompts when working with AI assistants. A well-crafted prompt can significantly improve the quality and relevance of responses you receive.

## Key Elements of Effective Prompts

### Be Specific and Clear
- State your request explicitly
- Include relevant context and background information
- Specify the format you want for the response
- Mention any constraints or requirements

### Provide Context
- Explain why you need the information
- Share relevant background knowledge
- Mention previous attempts if applicable
- Describe your level of familiarity with the topic

### Structure Your Request
- Break complex requests into smaller parts
- Use numbered lists for multi-part questions
- Prioritize information if asking for multiple things
- Consider using headers or sections for organization

### Specify Output Format
- Indicate preferred response length (brief vs. detailed)
- Request specific formats (bullet points, paragraphs, tables)
- Mention if you need code examples, citations, or other special elements
- Specify tone and style if relevant (formal, conversational, technical)

## Example Prompts

### Poor Prompt:
"Tell me about machine learning."

### Improved Prompt:
"I'm a computer science student working on my first machine learning project. Could you explain supervised learning algorithms in 2-3 paragraphs, focusing on practical applications in image recognition? Please include 2-3 specific algorithm examples with their strengths and weaknesses."

### Poor Prompt:
"Write code for a website."

### Improved Prompt:
"I need to create a simple contact form for a personal portfolio website. Could you write HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code for a responsive form that collects name, email, and message fields? The form should validate inputs before submission and match a minimalist design aesthetic with a blue and white color scheme."

## Iterative Prompting

Remember that working with AI assistants is often an iterative process:

1. Start with an initial prompt
2. Review the response
3. Refine your prompt based on what was helpful or missing
4. Continue the conversation to explore the topic further

## When Prompting for Code

When requesting code examples, consider including:

- Programming language and version
- Libraries or frameworks you're using
- Error messages if troubleshooting
- Sample input/output examples
- Performance considerations
- Compatibility requirements

## Conclusion

Effective prompting is a skill that develops with practice. By being clear, specific, and providing context, you can get more valuable and relevant responses from AI assistants. Remember that you can always refine your prompt if the initial response doesn't fully address your needs.
